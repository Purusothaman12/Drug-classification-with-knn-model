# Drug-classification-with-knn-model
ðŸ¤” ðŸ‘‰ This dataset contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. Machine learning model is needed in order to predict the outcome of the drugs type that might be suitable for the patient.

The main objective of using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model with a drug dataset is to predict or classify the type of drug based on certain features or attributes of the drugs. KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this context, the objective can be framed as follows:

Objective: Drug Classification using KNN

Dataset: The dataset contains information about various drugs, represented by different features such as chemical properties, molecular structure, usage, side effects, etc. Additionally, the dataset includes the class labels representing the types of drugs (e.g., painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, etc.).

Steps:

Data Preparation: Preprocess the drug dataset, which involves tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format.

Feature Selection: Identify the relevant features that are most informative for drug classification. This step helps to remove noise and irrelevant attributes, improving the performance of the model.

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the KNN model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance and generalization ability.

Model Training: Apply the KNN algorithm to the training set. The KNN algorithm works by finding the k-nearest neighbors to a given drug instance in the feature space and classifying the drug based on the majority class among its neighbors.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the KNN model using appropriate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the test set. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can generalize to new, unseen drug instances.
